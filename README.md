# Geo_Morph_Evolution_Lab
This is a repository for a Sophomore level evolution lab on Geometric Morphometrics using MorphoJ that I teach at DePaul University. The lab uses images of 90 stickleback fish from three populations collected in the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska. The three populations are an anadromous population from Anchor River (AR), a benthic lake population from Tern Lake, and a limnetic lake population from Stormy Lake. Each population consists of 30 specimens, 15 males and 15 females.

The repository includes a lab protocol, a tps data file with 16 landmarks digitized, a classifiers file for MorphoJ, and 6 folders with the specimen images and individual tps files. 

The included files are:

-0_Lab_6_Geo_Morph_students.doc - This is the lab protocol in Word format. It starts with a brief introduction and then guides the students through using MorphoJ to conduct a PCA and CVA.

-0_stickleback_evol_lab_data.TPS - This is the input data file for MorphoJ in TPS format. It includes landmark data for 90 stickleback fish.

-grp_b.txt - The classifiers file indicating specimen group membership for MorphoJ. Specimens are divided into 6 groups: 3 populations X 2 sexes.

-cva2.png - An image file showing the results of the CVA.

-CVs1_2.png - An image file showing the shape divergence associated with CVs 1 and 2.

-There are also 6 folders with the specimen pictures and individual tps files. This allows you to have students collect their own data or take other measures. However, the input file listed above (0_stickleback_evol_lab_data.TPS) already has all the landmark data and the lab is currently designed for students to work with landmark data that has been collected for them. In class, I demonstrate how to create the input files using TPSUtility and digitize landmarks on the images using TPSDig2.
